# 001 - Yii goals and values

## Goals

The Yii project goals are to build and maintain:

- Great tools.
- Great community.

## Values

We share some common values that apply to what we do.

### Being helpful

It applies to both technical decisions and community. Community-wise we value any high quality contribution, be it a
pull request or elaborative answer at the forum.

When following principles conflict we choose solution that is more helpful to community.

### Simplicity

Solutions should be simple yet elegant:

- We add complexity where necessary and avoid it otherwise.
- We do not tolerate ugly solutions unless there is no other way.
- Less rules are better than more rules.

### Explicitness

We prefer explicit solutions and code.

For example:

- Straightforward solution is better than over-abstracted one. That is not an excuse not to abstract though.
- Typecasting is better than type coercion, type-hinting is better than no type hinting.
- No magic unless necessary.
- Loud fails are preferred to silent fails.

### Consistency

We try being consistent in everything:

- Code style.
- Naming.
- Design.
- Structure.

### Convention over configuration

We provide sensible defaults and conventions that one could customize via configuration.
That allows to achieve flexibility without sacrificing simplicity.

### Practice-orientation

We prefer practice over theory.

For example:

- Solutions for known use cases should not over-engineered for flexibility if practically there is no need for it.
- Standard implementations should take practical usage into account.
- Experiments are preferred to theories.

## Performance

We believe that software should perform efficiently in terms of both resources consumption and how fast one can achieve goals using it.
